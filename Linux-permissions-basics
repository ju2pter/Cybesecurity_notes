# Linux Permissions & Access Control

## Understanding Permissions

Linux uses permissions to control access to files and directories.

There are three permission levels:

- Owner (user)
- Group
- Others

## Permission Types

Each level can have three types of permissions:

- Read (r) → view file contents
- Write (w) → modify file contents
- Execute (x) → run a file as a program

## Permission Structure

Example:

-rwxr-xr--


Breakdown:

- `-` → file type
- `rwx` → owner permissions
- `r-x` → group permissions
- `r--` → others permissions

## Numeric Representation

Permissions can also be represented numerically:

- 4 = read
- 2 = write
- 1 = execute

Examples:

- 7 (rwx)
- 6 (rw-)
- 5 (r-x)
- 4 (r--)
- 0 (---)

Example:

chmod 755 file.sh


## Why Permissions Are Important

- Protect sensitive data
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Maintain system integrity
- Reduce security risks

## Basic Commands

### View permissions
ls -l


### Change permissions
chmod 644 file.txt
chmod +x script.sh


### Change ownership
chown user:group file.txt


## Security Best Practices

- Avoid giving write permission to "others"
- Use execute permission only when necessary
- Restrict access to sensitive files
- Regularly review file permissions

Proper permission management is essential for maintaining system security.
